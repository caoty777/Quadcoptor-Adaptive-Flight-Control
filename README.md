# Quadcoptor Adaptive Flight Control
•	Implemented Model Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC) system on a Parrot quadcoptor (designed and simulated in Matlab&Simulink, implemented via Simulink hardware package)

•	Controlled four individual propellers’ speed to make the drone move smoothly to any desired position and orientation, with  mismatched drone parameters (mass, axial length, etc.) in the design process

File Description:
1. controller_simulation.m - MATLAB code to implement the MRAC flight control system for Parrot rolling-spider drone, together with several other controllers for performance comparison

2. final_report.pdf - a comprehensive project report
